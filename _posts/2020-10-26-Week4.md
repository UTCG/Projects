# Week 4: Materials (Physically Based and Non-Photorealistic Rendering)

Materials control how a 3D Mesh looks when it's rendered on to your screen. A simple mesh's appearance can be vastly altered by attaching different materials on them. For example, check out how this basic model can appear using four different materials:

Whether you are an artist or programmer primarily, materials are an important topic to understand. I'll be going over the philosphy around materials in the industry today, and attach some links in case you want to do any further research :)

For **artists**, you want to know how to modify parameters to achieve the look you desire, and what certain rendering options do.

For **programmers**, you'll want to know the basics on the code behind materials (Shaders) as well as how renderers can optimize draw calls and render out multiple objects of the same material concurrently.

Materials are a cornerstone for all 3D applications, whether it be a video game, animated film, or even digital design. It's a rapidly advancing field, but I'm going to very broadly lump them into two main catergories you'll see within the industry, **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)** and **Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR)**

# Physically Based Rendering (PBR)

# Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR)

Alternatively, there are a lot of instances where we don't want things to be physically based. We want the flexibility and creativity to stylize our renders in cartoonish or imaginative ways. You'll hear the acornym NPR a lot when talking about these techniques. Check out some of the effects used in NPR workflows:

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, uses a common toon lighting effect called [Cel Shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel_shading).

[Return of the Obra Dinn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/) uses a very cool [dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) filter over their meshes.
