# Week 4: Materials (Physically Based and Non-Photorealistic Rendering)

Materials control how a 3D Mesh looks when it's rendered on to your screen. A simple mesh's appearance can be vastly altered by attaching different materials on them. For example, check out how this basic model can appear using four different materials:

Whether you are an artist or programmer primarily, materials are an important topic to understand. I'll be going over the philosphy around materials in the industry today, and attach some links in case you want to do any further research :)

Materials are a cornerstone for all 3D applications, whether it be a video game, animated film, or even digital design. It's a rapidly advancing field, but I'm going to very broadly lump them into two main catergories you'll see within the industry, **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)** and **Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR)**

# Physically Based Rendering (PBR)

A Physically Based material is programmed with the intention to replicate (as closely as possible) how light actually interacts with different types of matter. There are certain physical "rules" you have to follow in order to write a physical based material. For example, all physically based materials should absorb and reflect the same amount of light energy as it recieves. In essence, it needs to be energy conserving. These materials also expose intuitive parameters so you can tweak the look to your desire. Whether you are rendering wood, plastic, metal, or anything else, the idea behind PBR is that if you understand the physical properities behind the object you are creating, you are able to tweak the parameters to get a realistic depiction of it in your render.    

Physically based materials are the industry's default material for the most part. Open up any 3D Application or Game Engine and you'll almost certainly see a physically based inspired material used as a default whenever you create an object. However, while many applications use very similar parameters, there is no "universal" PBR material. Every application generally makes slight modifications as they see fit. This is also why you might it to be tricky to transfer material information between ZBrush, Blender, 3DSMax, Unity, etc. They are all using their own version of a PBR inspired material. That being said, they do tend to share a lot of common parameters which I'll go over:

### Albedo
The overall base color across the surface

### Roughness (or alternatively Smoothness)
Basically, how rough is the object at a microscopic level (much smaller than what we can render in the size of a pixel). 

### Metallic
How "metallic" the surace is. The more metallic a surface is the less it scatters aborbed light, so you won't see the albedo color at all. The opposite of this are dielectrics like wood or skin, which should have a very low metallic value. This is absolutely an approximation since in real life materials are generally either a metal or they aren't, but this is generally implemented from a 0-1 sliding scale to allow you more freedom when defining your materials.


# Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR)

Alternatively, there are a lot of instances where we don't want things to be physically based. We want the flexibility and creativity to stylize our renders in cartoonish or imaginative ways. You'll hear the acornym NPR a lot when talking about these techniques. Check out some of the effects used in NPR workflows:

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, uses a common toon lighting effect called [Cel Shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel_shading).

[Return of the Obra Dinn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/) uses a very cool [dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) filter over their meshes.

[Journey's](https://thatgamecompany.com/journey/) sand looks very pretty, though according to their [tech write up]("https://www.alanzucconi.com/2019/10/08/journey-sand-shader-1/") on it, very little of it was actually based on how sand looks in real life. Instead they treated it much like a liquid or ocean so the character could feel like they are surfing along the sand dunes.

As you might expect, there are a lot less rules to non-photorealistic rendering.
