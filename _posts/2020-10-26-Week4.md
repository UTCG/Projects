# Week 4: Materials (Physically Based and Non-Photorealistic Rendering)

Materials control how a 3D Mesh looks when it's rendered on to your screen. A simple mesh's appearance can be vastly altered by attaching different materials on them. For example, check out how this basic model can appear using four different materials:

Whether you are an artist or programmer primarily, materials are an important topic to understand. 

For **artists**, you need to know how to modify parameters to achieve the look you desire, and what certain rendering options do.

For **programmers**, you'll want to know the basics on the code behind materials (Shaders) as well as how renderers can optimize draw calls and render out multiple objects of the same material all at the same time.
