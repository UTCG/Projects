Here's the first week's UTCG Projects learner track post!

# Welcome!

Hello Learners! Welcome to the very first week of UTCG Projects. The UTCG Execs and Mentors are very excited to work with you all! The theme for our first week of learner content revolves around **Python and Git**. These are two very versatile technologies that can help you in creating your projects.

Our role as Execs and Mentors is to collect different helpful resources of information, like tutorials, documentation, and guides that can help you develop your projects. Each week, UTCG Projects will have a different theme/topic, where we focus on teaching you different concepts that can help you develop your projects. **We accept suggestions for different themes!** Some theme examples may include **3d Modelling/Sculpting using Blender, Web Design, the Graphics Pipeline**, **Game Design**, and much more!

The curriculum is optional to complete on your own time, but we strongly recommend you read this entire handout and see what is available for you and your team. We also strongly recommend you work through the resources together, and **ask each other for help!**The mentors are also available to help and provide general advice**.


# Why Python and Git?

This year, we have lots of beginners who are new to programming, or have a little bit of experience from classes. Python and Git are two very popular tools for programming and developing collaborative projects. Here are descriptions of both and why we want to use them for this week and throughout the term.

**Python:** Is a very easy-to-learn and versatile programming language that allows for quick development. Some benefits include:

*   Taught in CSC108 and CSC148 (Beginner Computer Science Courses)
*   Syntax (ordering of letters and words in the language) is simple to learn and use
*   Very popular for scripting, which means you can automate lots of 3D modelling programs with Python
*   Many Libraries like OpenCV (Computer Vision), Tkinkter, NumPy (working with lots of data points and math), Django (web development), and many more!

**Git:** Git is a technology that allows for collaboration within your team, and version control. Git is useful for:

*   Having multiple copies of your work “saved”, and accessing it later on
*   Working together in a team simultaneously
*   Hosting a website for free

# Part 2: Next Steps for Python & Fun Libraries!

This section includes resources and descriptions of Python Libraries. “Libraries” are different sets of tools _you can use with Python to build your project. <u>For this week</u>, we will focus on introducing a few optional libraries to learn and why they are useful. This section can be a little more complicated, **so make sure you’re comfortable with the concepts from part 1 **in order to continue. 

*   **OpenCV:** If you want to process images, apply filters, and use computer vision techniques.
*   **NumPy:** You will often encounter huge sets of data points in computer graphics, and it’s useful to manage all of them. NumPy is one of the most popular and useful Python libraries for managing huge sets of data points by using arrays and matrices.

Here are some additional libraries you can look up! (Not required for week 1 but you might be interested!)
*   **Tkinkter:** Helpful for creating User Interfaces (think of windows, buttons, etc) for your program.
*   **Flask:** A Web framework used to easily create websites 
*   **PyTorch:** The largest machine learning library that allows developers to perform tensor computations with acceleration of GPU, creates dynamic computational graphs, and calculate gradients automatically.
*   **Scipy:** An open-source python library that is used for both scientific and technical computation. It is also very popular for image manipulation, as well.

Let’s get started with a couple of tutorials! There is no need to try all of them, but we recommend choosing a few that may be beneficial to your interests or your project.

### OpenCV

*   [Computer Vision for Beginners: Part 1: Introduction to OpenCV and Image Processing in Python (Jiwon Jeong)](https://towardsdatascience.com/computer-vision-for-beginners-part-1-7cca775f58ef)
    *   Includes OpenCV installation, how to open an image, converting image colours (RGB, BGR), drawing shapes on images, interactively drawing on a map
    *   You can also try out Parts 2, 3, and 4 after this article!
*   [Face Recognition with Python, in Under 25 Lines of Code](https://realpython.com/face-recognition-with-python/#understanding-the-code)
    *   A quick example of how to detect the number of faces in an image, and drawing rectangles for each face. Sounds easy under 25 lines, but it’s a little more challenging to understand than the other tutorials! Try the other tutorials first before running this one. This is a small glimpse if you want your project to include face recognition.
*   [Introduction to NumPy and OpenCV (Filippo Aleotti)](http://vision.deis.unibo.it/~smatt/DIDATTICA/Sistemi_Digitali_M/PDF/Introduction_to_NumPy_and_OpenCV.pdf)
    *   Includes more depth on how to use NumPy and mathematical matrix and vector operations for handling data. Very handy for doing huge math operations. Also includes how to use filters in OpenCV, a few short code examples on stereo, and 3 exercises at the end.


### NumPy

*   [A Beginners Guide to NumPy](https://medium.com/@kaaanishk/a-beginners-guide-to-numpy-251cdc6e0fd7) (Kanishk Srivasata)
    *   Includes an introduction to what NumPy Is, why it’s useful, how to set up NumPy array basics, arithmetic operations with arrays, and broadcasting. Also some very helpful diagrams to visualize what arrays are!
*   [NumPy: the absolute basics for beginners](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html)
    *   A detailed beginners tutorial on using NumPy. It’s a bit lengthy so you can jump to different sections of the content “On This Page” based on relevance and interest. Includes NumPy Installation, using NumPy Arrays, using matrices, using mathematical operations, and how to save/load.


# Questions and Suggestions?

It’s very natural to get stuck and frustrated with programming, especially if you’re new. Don’t hesitate to reach out to your group members for help. Your group members are the primary point of support if you need help. If it’s still difficult to fix errors or understand the code, the next step is to ask the Mentors for help in the Discord! We’re here to help you learn and stay excited about CG. Mentors can also help with guiding and providing advice for possible project ideas, and are excited to see what you can make with your skills!

If you’d like to see any specific lessons on certain technologies, please tell us! We want to design a curriculum that fits the interests of the students creating the projects, and we’re trying to find the most useful technologies that suits everyone’s needs.
