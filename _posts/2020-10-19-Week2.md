# Week ??: Modeling & Sculpting


We are going to learn how to model and sculpt in **Blender**, an awesome free-and-open-source 3D creation application!

Here are some things you might be able to make after the next few weeks. (These took me several hours each)

Of course, you can do many other things, like dragons, plants, clothes, landscapes, etc.

# Intro to Blender

To start, download and install the program from the [Blender homepage](https://blender.org).

When you first open Blender, there is a menu in the center. You can select *New File > General* to create a new project.

There is a cube in the center. Now to the controls:

*    Middle-click and drag to rotate
*    Shift+middle-click and drag to pan
*    Left-click to select
*    Right-click for a context menu

Note: if you don't have a mouse or a middle-click button you can follow the steps in this
[short article](http://www.blenderhut.com/use-blender-without-middle-mouse-button-or-scroll-wheel/) to use left-click and Alt/Shift/Ctrl keys.

Now, a few concepts. Usually, 3D models are represented as a collection or **mesh** of connected 2D polygons. The mesh has **vertices, edges, and faces** that can be manipulated.

Select the cube so that it has a yellow outline. Now, if you press the Tab key, you'll enter *Edit mode*. This is where most geometric modelling work is done. On the left side there is a toolbar with many tools, if you hover mouse over them it will say what the tool is for. Now, notice the 3 buttons in the top left (in the yellow square in the picture below). These represent Vertices, Edges, and Faces. You can try picking one of the buttons and then selecting part of the cube to see which parts are selected.

# Start Sculpting

Sculpting works on vertices, so to start we need to make some more vertices! Press Tab to exit the Edit mode (the top left should say *Object Mode*). Press Ctrl-5, and the cube should turn into a sphere.

Now, in the menu on the right side go to the Modifiers section (the wrench icon in the turquoise square shown above). You'll see that your Ctrl-5 created a Subdivision modifier. Click Apply. Now if you press Tab to go into Edit mode, you can see that we have lots of vertices. Now we can start sculpting!

Note: Blender 2.90 has a new sculpting mode (voxel sculpting), but I will go with the traditional sculpting mode for now.

At the top left of the screen, to the right of File/Edit/Render, there are tabs labelled *Layout, Modeling, Sculpting, UV Editing, ...*. Click on the Sculpting tab and now you should see your cube-sphere in a somewhat shiny red material. Try clicking and dragging your mouse over the sphere.

You can Ctrl-click/drag to subtract and Shift-click/drag to smooth. Press F and move the mouse to change the size of the brush (can also be done in the right side menu).

Try out the many brushes on the left toolbar and see what they do!

One final thing: sometimes, you might need more vertices in a particular place. In this case, enable the *Dyntopo* option in the lower part of the right side menu. This will make more vertices as you zoom in.

*Messing around with brushes*

That's it for this guide, now you can start exploring the huge world of digital sculpting!

# Resources

There are many many videos out there, here are a few good ones that I found.

*    [Blender 2.81 | New Sculpting Features for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzjzOSCEtqw) - good clear tutorial
*    [Sculpting in Blender 2.8 | Every Brush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3XtAFUWNuk) - shows what the brushes do
*    [Introduction to Sculpting in Blender 2.8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Wq8K8icpQ) - also shows brushes

If you want to make something, try searching for tutorials on how to sculpt humans, dragons, hair (!!), trees, etc. There are many videos of sculpting with other programs like ZBrush, the programs are very similar and you should be able to follow along in Blender.

Having experience with 2D drawing / art definitely helps when working in 3D, since many principles and techniques still apply.

When I first decided to try sculpting I wanted to dive right in so I found and followed along with this video, [how to model / sculpt a human head](https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSKsmyV9ISk). My result didn't turn out super nice but it was okay. After I was comfortable with basic sculpting I decided to try making the rest of the body, just by looking at reference images. Eventually, I ended up with the image below. We'll get to texturing and materials in the future.
